# Data_Vizu - 1st Vizu
The aim of this first visualisation is to anser the following questions : 
- How do baby names evolve over time?
- Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular?
- Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular?
- Are there trends in time?

To do that, we made 2 charts. The first one is presenting the most popular name through time. It shows to the user decades by decades, the most popular name for boys and girls. 
The second one, is presenting the evolution of rares firstnames with an popularity evolution which could be influenced by historical events. 

To use both of the graphs, you need to move your cursor over the graph according to the first name whose evolution you want to see over time.

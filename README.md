# Data_Vizu
The evolution of baby names in France throughout the 20th century. The aim is to provide a series of visualisations to observe the popularity of names over time, geography and events. 

# Data_Vizu - 1st Vizu
The aim of this first visualisation is to anser the following questions : 
- How do baby names evolve over time?
- Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular?
- Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular?
- Are there trends in time?

To do that, we made 2 charts. The first one is presenting the most popular name through time. It shows to the user decades by decades, the most popular name for boys and girls. 
The second one, is presenting the evolution of rares firstnames with an popularity evolution which could be influenced by historical events. 

To use both of the graphs, you need to move your cursor over the graph according to the first name whose evolution you want to see over time. 

# Data_Vizu - 2nd Vizu
The aim of this notebook is to create an interactive map showing the effect of regions on first names in France from 1900 to 2020. Users should be able to quickly see which departments have the same most popular first name, according to the national top 3. They can also place their cursor over the department to see details of the 3 most popular first names within the department, with the associated number. If the department has a most popular name other than the top 3, it is grayed out to show that it is outside the national top 3.
